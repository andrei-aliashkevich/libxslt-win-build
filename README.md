# libxslt-win-build

libxslt Windows build with Visual Studio.

[Work in progress] This version is libxslt-1.1.29.

See info-win-build for general information about the
win-build effort.

To build, simply open the required solution file, and
you know how to use Visual Studio, right?
(or perhaps this is the wrong place for you.)
